#Introduction Text
Hello!  If you somehow found your way to this review, then feel free to look at it this guide to prepare for a technical interview in a software engineer interview. I made this guide after looking at many online resources for the best way to prepare for interviews, and all the topics that I saw listed in those many resources will be listed here.  Look at what you need the most help in and hopefully it can help.  **Please note**, that I wrote this guide after my senior year of university where in the last year I focused on my secondary math major classes, so my coding experience was way behind on what I would've liked/should've been.  As such, it will be on a comprehensive guide starting from very basic topics eventually progressing to the complex topics.  **PLEASE DO, submit a request if you see something that is glaringly wrong**.  *I will try to make it orginal to my own understanding, but I am basing it on many sources from online hopefully there isn't anything that is a direct copy. If you notice anything like so, please reach out to me immediatly and I humbly apologize.  Do recgonize that for most basic data structures and algorithms the solutions are quite easy as such may look similar/identical.*
