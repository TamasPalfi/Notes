#Python3 Technical Interview Notes
Notes for **Python3 interview basics** will be located here.  It will primarily consist of basic topics that are commonly tested on **technical interviews** such as string methods, integer methods, common data structures, common algorithms, and so on.  Will eventually include more complex things as my preparation goes further.  I will be including anything that I feel the need to have a 2nd look on before any technical interview.  This will likely be my most extensive technical interview notes page as I am currently focused on improving my python skills with the **goal of obtaining a data science or ML job** out of college.  Most of these notes will be the results of practicing technical questions on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).  Check out the website, it is a great resource to prep for an interview in any language.  * * These notes are for public use but please cite me (@TamasPalfi) if showcase it elsewhere* *.
